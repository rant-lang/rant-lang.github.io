                <h1>Installing Rant</h1>
                <p>
                    The easiest way to install Rant is with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html" target="_blank">Cargo</a>.
                    These instructions should be exactly the same for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Verify your Cargo installation and then type the following into your favorite shell:
                </p>
                <code block>
                    cargo install rant --all-features
                </code>
                <p>
                    If you are installing a prerelease version, you will also need to add a <code>--version</code> option with the desired version number.
                    For example, if you wanted to install the 6th alpha release, you would add <code>--version=4.0.0-alpha.6</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once Rant has finished installing, you can run the CLI in REPL mode by typing <code>rant</code> in your shell and pressing Enter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should be greeted by a prompt similar to the one shown below: 
                </p>
                <code block>
                    Rant 4.0.0-alpha.6 (x86_64-pc-windows-msvc)<br/>
                    Run this tool with --help for available options.<br/>
                    >>
                </code>
                <p>
                    If this displays, Rant is installed and working! You can now type Rant code and press Enter to see its output.
                </p>

                    <h2>Using Rant in your application or library</h2>
                    Chances are good that you are a developer interested in integrating Rant into your program.
                    Perfect! This is even easier than installing it as a standalone application.

                        <h3>Rust</h3>
                        <p>
                            Since Rant is written in Rust, importing it into your Rust project is 
                            as simple as adding the following line to the dependencies section of your Cargo.toml:
                        </p>
                        <code block>
                            rant = "*"
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            That's it!
                        </p>

                        <h3>Other languages</h3>
                        <p>
                            As of writing this, Rant does not currently have any wrappers for usage in other languages;
                            however, priority will be given to developing .NET and WebAssembly wrappers in the near future. 
                            Be sure to keep an eye out!
